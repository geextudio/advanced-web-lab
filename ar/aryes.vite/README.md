# AR, Yes!

## [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)

```bash
# 安装依赖
yarn 

# 热更新开发调试
yarn dev
```

NOTE:
>Vite supports importing `.ts` files and `<script lang="ts">` in Vue SFCs out of the box.
> 
>Vite uses esbuild to transpile TypeScript into JavaScript which is about 20~30x faster than vanilla tsc, and HMR updates can reflect in the browser in under 50ms.
